            There are countless tools that promise control. You've probably tried a few. Yet here you are.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
            Most inventory systems are either overwhelming, inflexible, brittle, or all three. You know?
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
            Not ours. We're former ERP architects who've built 9-figure ERP systems for global brands, we built a Shopify-first IMS that's refreshingly straightforward. We know how important it is to listen to customer feedback.

          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
            Your store doesn't sleep and it evolves in days, not months—so do we. Tell us what hurts; we'll change fast and tell you when it's fixed.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
            We're not going to wave a wall of logos at you. Instead, we earn trust the simple way: No theatrics. Just dependable software and accountable humans. No mystery. No black box.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 italic">
            You run the store. We'll mind the inventory.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 text-gray-700">
            It's no-nonsense, effective, reliable. The trifecta. Designed for smaller, hungrier brands who need control without enterprise bloat.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
            Kick the tires—try it out for free, tell us what breaks. We'll fix it. We'd be honored to have you as a customer and join our journey. Thank you.
